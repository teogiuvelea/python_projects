Some of the downloaded songs won't have bit rate so to fix that I use this site 'https://online-audio-converter.com/' to convert them into .mp3 format even though they were already converted by python library into mp3.
If the song is played on a car fm transmitter from a usb stick it won't work if it doesn't have bit rate.
Playing the songs on a computer works just fine.
I tested it on my car, it actually took me a few hours to figure that out. 

How the program works, steps:
1. Write band and song title in songs.txt file
2. Run main.py file
3. Files downloaded will be saved in songs directory
